        <h1>Bananas</h1>
<p>10 May 2023</p>

<p>[This page is still a work in progress]</p>
<p>A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by
several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus
Musa.</p>
<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called
“plantains”, distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is
variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and
curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be
green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.</p>
<p>[The above is the “starter” post for Jekyll, the static site
generator doing some light behind the scenes work here.]</p>
<p>I suspect that no one really likes how bananas taste. I’ve heard
numerous people tell me otherwise, so perhaps I need to update my views
here, but let’s run with this line of thought for a while. Suppose that
everyone secretly disliked bananas. What would motivate the average
person to spend money on a food she doesn’t like? In practice, people do
things they don’t like fairly often, because some contingent benefit
makes up for a given detriment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious perk of bananas are their peels. The peel of
a banana is durable, inedible <a href="#footnotes-1">[1]</a>, and
provides a strong indicator of the ripeness of the fruit contained
within. These durable peels make bananas a good “portable snack,” in
that they fare better than many other fruits when haphazardly tossed
into a bag. Apples exhibit this behavior to a slightly lesser degree as
well but this is mostly due to the rigidity of the apple itself, rather
than the peel of the fruit. Over the course of a harvested banana’s
lifetime, it undergoes fairly dramatic changes in flavor profile as it
ripens. There is a surprising variety in preference among banana
enthusiasts for bananas in each stage of ripening, and the coloration of
the banana peel provides a very predictable indication of the state of
the banana within.</p>
<p>Still it feels wrong to be selecting a fruit based on the peel,
despite these benefits. This wonderful peel becomes something of an
inconvenience once the fruit has been eaten. If you have a trash can, or
compost bin nearby, sure, the peel can be discarded and forgotten. The
peel will decompose better than the plastic bags you used a decade ago
to carry your groceries home from the store. In the worst case scenario,
you’re left carrying a banana peel in your bag (hopefully you brought a
container of sorts so your peel doesn’t get on your papers) for the rest
of the day. It’s not so bad. You get home, toss your banana peel, and
look at the 5 other, identical tasting bananas sitting on your shelf,
waiting patiently for their chance to be eaten.</p>
<p>Why should we be choosing our foods based on their portability? Now
that re-usable containers have been around for a while, the typical US
banana eater could carry around a box of blueberries for approximately
the same amount of hassle as a banana, and I suspect the typical US
banana eater secretly prefers the flavor profile of blueberries to
bananas.</p>
