<p>A semi-anonymous blog about math, CS, and various other interests. I
believe that writing is an incredibly important skill, and one that
takes lots of practice to truly develop, and this is a semi-public means
to grow those skills. Check out the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page
for more general information, else peruse the links below.</p>
