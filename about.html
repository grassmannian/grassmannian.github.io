        <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I’d like to keep this site mostly anonymous. If you are in a position
to dox me, I kindly ask you to refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>I have a rather diverse set of interests, and lack sufficient time to
pursue any of them as well as I’d like. I knew Chinese (Mandarin)
decently at some point in my life, but it’s a rapidly atrophying skill.
I became proficient in Latin recently, but fear it will go the way of
Chinese (but hopefully not before I finish reading Vergilius). I
sometimes unicycle around town, I’ve been known to play in a community
orchestra here and there, I attempt to read books, but haven’t found a
good way to parallelize reading multiple books concurrently.</p>
<p>I am interested in cryptography and number theory, and have a book or
two on the subject open at any given time. Having spent some time
working with air-gapped systems, I have a nascent interest in
TEMPEST-style attacks and data exfiltration on air-gapped systems, but
no real experience with either. I’m mildly interested in finance,
ethics, and the interaction therein. I like to imagine how modern
finances would look with a strict prohibition on usury. I’m also
interested in predicting the future. If someone know or sincerely
believes something will happen in the future, and not everyone agrees,
there should be an easy way to turn a profit from that inefficiency in
the “knowledge market.”</p>
<p>I’m also looking for a job. If you stumble across this site and are
interested in discussing potential fitness for a role, feel free to
reach out via email;
<a href="mailto: &#118;&#100;&#108;&#110;&#064;&#112;&#109;&#046;&#109;&#101;">
vdln@pm.me </a>. I’ve pared down much of my presence on Github in the
wake of Github Copilot, but some of my smaller, more recent work can be
found at <a

<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>
<p>Why does this site look the way it does? I suspect a lot of it boils
down to 3 main observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tabbed web browsers are a questionable design choice (I’ll write
about this in the future)</li>
<li>Less CSS/Javascript to worry about</li>
<li>Less data to download over my artificially slow internet
connection</li>
</ol>
